# Accordion

## Description

I have intentionally avoided all preprocessors and build tools and created this accordion with just CSS, HTML and JS. I have included utility classes which I would see as being used by this component and others.

### Browsers

Tested in:

- Chrome (Linux)
- Firefox (Linux)
- Edge (Linux)
- Chrome (Android)

#### Small print

I don't work for Sega, I'm just a fan, and no copyright infringement is intended through the use of their logo. I based the design on their iconic Master System and Mega Drive box art.
